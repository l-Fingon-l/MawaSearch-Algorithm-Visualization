# Mawa-Search Algorithm

A friend of mine [had introduced](https://github.com/Miezhiko/stalin-binary-search) her own binary search variety for Hacktoberfest.  

The algorithm had not been any serious whatsoever.  
Our response, however, was.

# Visualization

This [tool](https://yanefingon.github.io/Mawa-Search-Algorithm-Visualization/) written in JS in client-side manner and hosted via Github Pages allows for visualization of a wide range of sorting or searching algorithms and might be pretty useful to those trying to get a better understanding of their algorithms.

This particular configuration is tuned to the Mawa-Search binary search algorithm visualisation and comes pretty handy reasoning the effectiveness and safety of the algorithm, showing off some of its pitfalls and bugs.

# Theoretical analysis

In addition to the visualisation tool itself, a profound theoretical analysis of the algorithm was written and implemented into the project's documentation.  

The papers that are paired with maths proofs and are colourfully illustrated might now be found here:

- [The importance of left-right pointer locker](https://github.com/Miezhiko/stalin-binary-search/blob/mawa/docs/overcrossing_pointers_vulnerability.md)
